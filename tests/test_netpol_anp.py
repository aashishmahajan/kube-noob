"""AdminNetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy change the answer, so they are evaluated.

The NetworkPolicy evaluator used to list ANP and BANP under "not evaluated". That is not a gap in coverage, it is a
wrong verdict: an ANP ``Deny`` blocks traffic every NetworkPolicy allows, an ANP ``Allow`` permits traffic every
NetworkPolicy denies, and a BANP decides the cases no NetworkPolicy selects. Precedence is ANP, then NetworkPolicy,
then BANP; within the ANP tier, lower ``priority`` first and then rule order, first match wins.
