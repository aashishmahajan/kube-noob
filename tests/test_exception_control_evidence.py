"""An exception must not erase the control it was filed against.

`Report.as_dict` builds `controlSummary` from `self.findings`. The exceptions filter in `Toolkit.audit` replaced
that list with the findings that survived, and only then called `as_dict` -- so a control whose only evidence was
an excepted finding dropped out of the report entirely.

That is backwards for a compliance record. An exception is an owned, reviewed, expiring decision *about* a
control; it is the case where you most want the control still named. Before this fix, filing one well-formed
exception against KN-N001 on a bundled example removed AC-4, SC-7 and SC-7(5) from `controlSummary`, leaving them
indistinguishable from controls no rule had ever looked at.
