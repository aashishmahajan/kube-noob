"""A control that was checked and is clean must not look like a control nothing evaluated.

`controlSummary` listed only controls that had findings, so an empty list meant either "every check
passed" or "no check ran", and nothing in the output could tell them apart. Every compliance claim
built on that inherits the same ambiguity, and claiming satisfaction from silence is the specific
failure FedRAMP's own guidance warns about.

The module docstring in controls.py already argued this for excepted findings -- "a control somebody
signed off on indistinguishable from a control nothing evaluated... the one confusion a compliance
record must not create". This applies the same principle to the other direction.
