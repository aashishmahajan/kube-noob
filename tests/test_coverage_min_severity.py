"""A rule that FIRED must never be counted clean because the caller filtered its finding out (G199).

`--min-severity high` filters the report's findings but not the record of which rules ran, so every rule whose
finding was withheld used to land in `clean`: `CP-10` went from "3 findings, 6 clean" to "0 findings, 9 clean",
and the compliance output then said nine rules ran and found nothing. Three of them had found something.
