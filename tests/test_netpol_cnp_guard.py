"""A ClusterNetworkPolicy in the input must never be dropped without a word.

`policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1` AdminNetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy are listed by
kubernetes-sigs/network-policy-api as "Previous (APIs that have evolved to the next stage and are no longer actively
developed)". The API under active development is `ClusterNetworkPolicy` v1alpha2, one cluster-scoped CRD carrying
both tiers in `spec.tier`. Calico enforces it from 3.32; what other
CNIs do is not something upstream states, and `cni.py` says so rather than guessing.

kube-noob did not know the kind at all, so a cluster-scoped Admin-tier Deny written in the current API was dropped
in silence: the verdict was attributed to the NetworkPolicy tier, and the proposed fix was a NetworkPolicy that the
Admin tier would override -- applied, changing nothing. A tool whose pitch is that it says what it could not
determine cannot do that.

Since P4 the kind is EVALUATED, so these tests assert the stronger thing: the policy decides, by name and by
rule, and the fix proposed is one that would actually work. The caveat they were written for is gone, and what
replaces it has to be checked just as hard -- an answer that is confidently right is one defect away from an
answer that is confidently wrong.
