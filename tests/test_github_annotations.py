"""Gate findings as GitHub annotations, which is where a developer actually looks (roadmap N12).

`gate --sarif` has always written SARIF, and `action.yml` has always run the gate, but nothing turned a finding
into an annotation -- so a finding landed in a log somebody had to go looking for. The constraint that shapes
this is GitHub's own: "10 warning annotations, 10 error annotations, and 10 notice annotations per step" and "50
annotations per job" (actions/toolkit, docs/problem-matchers.md, retrieved 2026-11-05). Emitting one per finding
would therefore drop the rest SILENTLY, and a developer who sees ten annotations and assumes that is all of them
has been misled by the tool -- the same defect as a count that stops being true.

So the last annotation of each kind is spent saying how many were not shown.
