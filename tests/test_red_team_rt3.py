``audit -f DIR`` and ``gate -f DIR`` are the CI surfaces. Both walked the directory, read every ``.yaml`` as UTF-8
and concatenated the lot into one document before parsing, so a single file that is not valid UTF-8 or not valid
YAML decided the outcome for the whole directory - and decided it without naming itself.
