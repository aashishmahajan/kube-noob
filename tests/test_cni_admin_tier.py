"""A policy the CNI does not enforce must not decide the answer (roadmap P7).

kube-noob evaluates AdminNetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy with OVN-Kubernetes semantics. Calico does
not enforce either from 3.32 onward -- "they stop taking effect silently" (Tigera upgrade notes) -- so on such a
cluster the tier kube-noob trusts most is the one that does nothing, and a `Deny` it reports is a deny that is not
happening. Cilium is listed upstream with only a tracking issue and no stated support, so for Cilium the answer is
not "enforced" and not "ignored": it is unknown, and an unknown must not read as either.
