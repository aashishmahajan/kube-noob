Three times in one release cycle a green check meant nothing: the chart's Route passed both probes while every MCP
call answered 421; `kube-noob doctor` printed `posture: OK` with no SDK and no key; and the `site` job of a release
printed SUCCESS while doing nothing at all, because `SITE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` was unset -- it warned and `exit 0`. The
site then served the previous release's media under the new release's banner for a day, and nobody saw a red check.

A missing secret is a real failure of the thing the job exists to do. It belongs in the part of the run a person
looks at, which is the conclusion, not a warning annotation nobody opens.
