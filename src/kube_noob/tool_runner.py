"""Run one kube-noob tool the way every surface does.

Validate the arguments against the tool's model, call it, stamp ``knowledgeAsOf`` and neutralise text shaped like
instructions to a model (``kube_noob.sanitize``). The MCP server, its REST routes and the Agent Skill runner
(``skill/kube-noob/scripts/kn.py``) all call this, so a tool answers the same everywhere. It imports neither the MCP
SDK nor the HTTP stack, so the skill runs with pydantic, PyYAML and jsonschema only.
