"""OSCAL assessment-results for an audit report (roadmap P3).

Pure serialisation of what the audit already computed. It reads the report's public dict -- the same shape
`kube-noob audit --format json` prints -- so an exceptions file that rebuilds the control summary is reflected
without this module knowing about exceptions at all. Only `audit` is wired to it; `gate` has no `--oscal` flag,
because the gate report carries findings but no coverage record (roadmap P3).

The coverage record is what makes this honest. `controlSummary` reports `findings`, `clean` and `notEvaluated`
per control (G191), so a control whose rules ran and found nothing is `satisfied`, a control with findings is
`not-satisfied`, and a control NO rule evaluated is named under `exclude-controls` and given no finding at all.
Without that record the document would have claimed satisfaction from silence, which is the failure FedRAMP's
own guidance names; when the record is absent (an older caller) this module degrades to reporting only the
controls that have findings and says so in the remarks, rather than inventing coverage.

Every field was written against NIST's published schema and catalogue, not from recollection:

* `oscal_assessment-results_schema.json` from the OSCAL **v1.2.3** release gives the required members:
  `assessment-results` needs `uuid`, `metadata`, `import-ap`, `results`; a `result` needs `uuid`, `title`,
  `description`, `start`, `reviewed-controls`; a `finding` needs `uuid`, `title`, `description`, `target`; an
  `observation` needs `uuid`, `description`, `methods`, `collected`.
* `finding-target.type` is an enum of exactly `statement-id` and `objective-id`, so a finding may NOT target a
  control directly. It targets the control's objective id, `ac-6.10_obj`, which the catalogue defines.
* Control ids are catalogue ids, not the labels in `controls.py`: `AC-6(10)` is `ac-6.10`. Parentheses are not
  legal in OSCAL's `TokenDatatype` (``^(\\p{L}|_)(\\p{L}|\\p{N}|[.\\-_])*$``), so emitting the label would
  produce a document that cannot validate. All 28 of kube-noob's controls and their `_obj` ids resolve in
  `NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json`, and a test holds that mapping.
* That same ``\\p{L}`` is why CI validates with ajv rather than Python's `jsonschema`: Python's `re`
  cannot compile a Unicode property escape, so `jsonschema` raises `PatternError` the moment validation
  reaches a token -- which any document complete enough to be worth checking does, including one whose
  only fault is an illegal control id. It cannot check this schema at all. (An earlier note here said it
  SKIPS the pattern and would call an invalid document valid. That was wrong: it fails loudly rather than
  quietly. The conclusion stands, the stated mechanism did not, and the test now pins the real behaviour.)

`import-ap` is required by the schema and kube-noob has no assessment plan, so it defaults to a local fragment
whose remarks say plainly that no plan was imported and that this is evidence about controls rather than an
assessment against a plan. A pipeline that has one passes `import_ap`.

Determinism: every uuid is a v5 uuid over stable content, so two runs over the same bundle produce the same
document and CI can diff it. The timestamp is the one value that moves, and the caller supplies it.
