"""Attack paths: from what is exposed to what a compromised pod could do (requirements R3.2). Read-only, tier R.

A path starts at an exposure (a Route, an Ingress, a LoadBalancer, NodePort or externalIPs Service), goes to the
Service and the workloads it selects, and ends at what those pods can do if an attacker runs code in them:

- on the node: a privileged container, a hostPath volume (the container runtime socket or a system directory is
  worst), the host's PID, network or IPC namespace, or near-root capabilities;
- through the Kubernetes API, with the ServiceAccount token mounted in the pod: the RBAC it is bound to (read
  Secrets, exec into pods, create or change workloads, escalate, bind or impersonate, nodes/proxy, full control), and
  on OpenShift a privileged SecurityContextConstraints it may use together with the right to create workloads.

Each path scores exposure x blast radius (internet 3, node network or restricted load balancer 2, internal network 1;
blast radius 1-10, cluster-wide above namespace) and lists every step with the field that proves it. Paths are ranked
by score, then by fewer steps.

What it reads: Routes, Ingresses, Services, workloads, ServiceAccounts, Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles,
ClusterRoleBindings and SecurityContextConstraints, from manifests or (``--live``) the cluster's read-only allowlist.
Never Secrets: Secret objects in a bundle are dropped before analysis, and the live allowlist refuses them. Not
modelled: NetworkPolicies on the entry edge (``kube-noob policy reach`` checks them), cloud IAM, admission-time
mutation (an SCC adding a UID), and tokens mounted by hand through projected volumes.

The built-in ClusterRoles cluster-admin, admin, edit and view are known by their documented meaning when a bundle
does not carry them (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles: edit and admin
can read Secrets and run pods as any ServiceAccount of the namespace; view cannot read Secrets).
