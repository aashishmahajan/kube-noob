"""ClusterNetworkPolicy v1alpha2, evaluated offline (P4).

``policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2`` replaces AdminNetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy with one
cluster-scoped kind carrying both tiers in ``spec.tier``. Calico 3.32 **removed** ANP and BANP enforcement in
favour of it -- "You must migrate to ClusterNetworkPolicy before upgrading to v3.32" -- so on such a cluster the
policy that actually decides is this kind, and the two :mod:`kube_noob.debug.anp` evaluates are the ones that no
longer apply. Until this module existed, ``policy reach`` answered ``undetermined`` whenever one was in the
input: honest, and useless on the clusters where it is the only policy that matters.

Precedence, from the API's own documentation of ``spec.tier``:

1. **Admin tier** -- every Admin-tier policy by ``priority`` ascending, rules in order, first match wins.
   ``Accept`` and ``Deny`` are final. ``Pass`` ends this tier and hands the decision to the NetworkPolicy tier.
2. **NetworkPolicy** -- the namespaced evaluation in :mod:`kube_noob.debug.netpol`. A NetworkPolicy that selects
   the pod for that direction decides finally, and the Baseline tier is not consulted.
3. **Baseline tier** -- every Baseline-tier policy by ``priority`` ascending. ``Accept`` and ``Deny`` are final.
4. No match in any tier: allowed, which is Kubernetes' own default.

Why this is a module and not a flag on :mod:`kube_noob.debug.anp`. Four things changed, and each one would make
the v1alpha1 evaluator read a valid v1alpha2 policy *wrong* rather than refuse it:

* ``Allow`` is renamed **``Accept``**. The old action list rejects every valid Admin rule.
* ``ports`` is replaced by **``protocols``**: a list of ``{tcp|udp|sctp: {destinationPort: {number|range}}}``
  plus ``destinationNamedPort``. The old matcher reads an absent ``ports`` key as "every port", so handing it a
  v1alpha2 rule scoped to one port would widen the rule to every port -- a verdict that is wrong in the
  dangerous direction.
* The Baseline tier is no longer a singleton named ``default``, and it carries ``priority`` like the Admin tier.
  ``Pass`` is in the action enum for both tiers.
* Every list is capped at **25** items rather than 100.

And one rule the v1alpha1 evaluator has no equivalent of, which the API states outright: a peer with no
recognised field means the CRD is a version this reader does not understand, and the implementation **fails
closed** -- "for Accept rules, treat the rule as matching no traffic; for Deny and Pass rules, treat the rule as
a Deny all rule". That is the opposite of skipping it, and it is the whole reason a reader of this API cannot be
permissive about shapes it does not know.

Verified against kubernetes-sigs/network-policy-api at 2383f01,
``apis/v1alpha2/clusternetworkpolicy_types.go``: the action enum, the tier enum, ``priority`` 0-1000 in both
tiers, the protocol and port unions, the peer fields, the MaxItems of 25, and the fail-closed paragraph.

As with the v1alpha1 tiers, :mod:`kube_noob.debug.cni` decides whether these policies are enforced at all: when
the caller names a CNI that does not implement them, they are withheld rather than fed through this module.
