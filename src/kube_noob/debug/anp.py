"""AdminNetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy, evaluated offline.

These two cluster-scoped resources (``policy.networking.k8s.io``) sit on either side of NetworkPolicy, so leaving
them out does not narrow an answer, it changes it: an AdminNetworkPolicy ``Deny`` blocks traffic every NetworkPolicy
in the namespace allows, an ``Allow`` permits traffic every NetworkPolicy denies, and a BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy
decides the traffic no NetworkPolicy selects at all.

Precedence, as OVN-Kubernetes implements it:

1. **AdminNetworkPolicy** - every policy by ``priority`` ascending (lower number first), rules within a policy in
   order, first match wins. ``Allow`` and ``Deny`` are final. ``Pass`` ends this tier and hands the decision down.
   No match anywhere in the tier also hands it down: the tier has no implicit deny of its own.
2. **NetworkPolicy** - the namespaced evaluation in ``kube_noob.debug.netpol``. If any NetworkPolicy selects the pod
   for that direction, its answer is final and the baseline is not consulted.
3. **BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy** - the singleton named ``default``. ``Allow`` and ``Deny`` only, no priority, first
   matching rule wins. No match means allowed.

Sources: https://ovn-kubernetes.io/features/network-security-controls/admin-network-policy/ and
https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-overview/.

Upstream is replacing both with a single ``ClusterNetworkPolicy`` in v1alpha2, and **this module does not
evaluate it**. The two tiers survive as a ``tier`` field, but the semantics are not the same and nothing here
should be reused on a v1alpha2 document without reading each of these:

* ``Allow`` is renamed ``Accept``, so :data:`ANP_ACTIONS` rejects every valid v1alpha2 Admin rule.
* ``Pass`` is legal in the Baseline tier, which :data:`BANP_ACTIONS` does not allow.
* The ``ports`` field is replaced by ``protocols``, with ``tcp``/``udp``/``sctp`` each carrying a
  ``destinationPort``. :func:`_port_matches` treats an absent ``ports`` key as "every port", which is right for
  v1alpha1 -- so simply adding the kind to :func:`collect` would read a rule scoped to one port as a blanket
  rule, and widen every verdict. That is worse than not reading the kind at all.
* The Baseline tier is no longer a singleton named ``default``, which :func:`collect` requires.
* Egress peers gain ``nodes``, ``networks`` and ``domainNames``. A CIDR is matched when the other side is an
  address, or when it is ``0.0.0.0/0`` or ``::/0``. A peer that might match and cannot be checked stops the
  tier as ``undetermined``; it is not skipped so a later rule can allow the traffic.
* The per-list cap fell from 100 items to 25.

Until that work is done, ``ClusterNetworkPolicy`` is listed in
:data:`kube_noob.debug.netpol.CLUSTER_SCOPED_ABOVE_NETWORKPOLICY`, which makes ``policy reach`` answer
``undetermined`` rather than guess. This matters on current clusters rather than future ones: Calico 3.32
removed AdminNetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy enforcement outright in favour of
``ClusterNetworkPolicy``, so on such a cluster the policy that actually decides is the kind this module cannot
read.
