"""Is this a reported issue? Match an error against the OpenShift release notes and the local Red Hat Jira copy.

The index holds every known issue (open in a release) and every fixed issue (fixed in a release or update) that the
release notes link to an issue id, for the minor releases in the bundled snapshot. The query is the text plus the
terms of the signals it carries or implies (``kube_noob.signals``: an alert name, an event reason, "leader changed"
for etcd leader elections). A match is returned only when the text itself shares rare words with the issue, backed by
more rare words, a strong score or the signal's terms, so a generic error (OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff) does not pull
in an unrelated bug. The frozen eval ``data/evals/known_issue_recall.yaml`` gates recall and precision. Each match
carries the issue link, the release-notes file it came from, whether a fix exists, and what that means for the
version the user runs.

Data: ``kube_noob/data/known_issues/*.json`` (refreshed with ``scripts/vendor_known_issues.py``) plus, when present,
a newer copy in ``<dataDir>/known_issues/`` written by ``kube-noob corpus known-issues --online``.

When the install keeps a local copy of Red Hat's public Jira (``kube-noob corpus jira --online``), tickets that match
are added with what became of them: fixed and in which release, still open, or closed as not a bug, won't fix or a
duplicate (see ``kube_noob.tickets``). A release-note issue that is also in the copy gains the ticket's current state.
