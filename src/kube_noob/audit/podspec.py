#: Kinds that carry one or more pod specs somewhere other than the nine places above, with ``*`` standing for
#: every element of a list (or every value of a mapping). Every path here was read out of the published CRD
#: schema on 2026-11-06, not inferred from a tutorial:
#:
#: * ``serving.kserve.io/v1beta1`` InferenceService -- `predictor`, `transformer` and `explainer` are each a
#:   full PodSpec inline (all of `containers`, `volumes`, `serviceAccountName`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`,
#:   `initContainers`, `securityContext`, `hostNetwork`, `hostPID`, `hostIPC`,
#:   `automountServiceAccountToken` appear in the schema), from
#:   config/crd/full/serving.kserve.io_inferenceservices.yaml.
#: * ``ray.io/v1`` and ``v1alpha1`` RayCluster -- `headGroupSpec.template` and each `workerGroupSpecs[].template`
#:   are ordinary PodTemplateSpecs (`metadata` + `spec`), from
#:   helm-chart/kuberay-operator/crds/ray.io_rayclusters.yaml.
#: * RayService wraps the same cluster under `rayClusterConfig`, RayJob under `rayClusterSpec`.
#:
#: Why this exists: without it every pod-level rule in the catalogue returns nothing for these objects. A
#: KServe predictor running privileged, as root, with `hostPath: /` and a mutable tag produced **14 findings
#: as a Deployment and zero as an InferenceService** -- not "not evaluated", clean (G229).

#: left a privileged `model:` container producing 2 findings where the same spec as `containers` produced 11,
#: with every container rule recorded as evaluated-clean on it. Each key below is a full `v1.Container` in the
#: published schema (`image` and `securityContext` among 30+ properties), read from
#: config/crd/full/serving.kserve.io_inferenceservices.yaml on 2026-11-06:
#:
#: * `predictor`: `model`, and the ten framework shorthands it replaced, all still served;
#: * `explainer`: `art`;
#: * `transformer`: none -- it has `containers` only, which is why this registry is keyed by path, not by kind.

    equally safe:

    * A positive match on a subset stays a match on the whole, because `matchLabels`, `In` and `Exists` only ever
      require a label to be present -- adding labels cannot break them. So True is returned as True.
