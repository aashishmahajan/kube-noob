"""NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls each audit rule gives evidence for.

FedRAMP (Rev5 baselines and the 20x Key Security Indicators) and most US federal frameworks are expressed in NIST SP
800-53 controls. Mapping every rule to the controls it supports lets an audit report double as configuration evidence
for CM-6, AC-6, SC-7 and the rest. A mapping says which control a finding is evidence about; it is not an assessment
and does not make a system compliant.

    """Controls touched by a set of findings, most findings first: for an audit report.

    ``excepted_rule_ids`` are the rules whose findings an exceptions file accepted. They are counted separately
    and they still put their controls in the list. An exception is a reviewed, owned, expiring decision about a
    control -- it is evidence *about* that control, so a control held only by excepted findings must stay named.
    Dropping it would make a control somebody signed off on indistinguishable from a control nothing evaluated,
    which is the one confusion a compliance record must not create.

    ``evaluated_rule_ids`` is every rule that actually ran. With it, that same confusion is resolved for the
    other direction too: a control whose rules ran and found nothing is reported with ``clean``, and one whose
    rules did not run at all is reported with ``notEvaluated``, instead of both being absent from the list.
    Without it the older shape is kept, so a caller that cannot say what ran does not get a coverage claim it
    has not earned.

    ``fired_rule_ids`` is every rule that produced a finding BEFORE the caller's severity filter. Without it,
    `--min-severity high` moved every rule whose finding was withheld into ``clean``: CP-10 went from "3
    findings, 6 clean" to "0 findings, 9 clean", and the record then said nine rules ran and found nothing when
    three of them had found something. Those rules are counted as ``withheld`` instead -- not a finding in this
    view, and emphatically not clean (G199).
