# Architecture

kube-noob has no model inside. The server, the CLI and the plugin run deterministic code: rules, schemas, playbooks,
a BM25 index and graders. A model appears only on the client side (Claude, Lightspeed, any MCP client) or in the
optional `kube-noob ask` agent, which calls the same toolkit.

## Request flow (run_protocol)

1. **Clarify** - platform/version inference (blueprint > explicit > request text > manifest API groups), blocking
   questions vs stated assumptions.
2. **Validate** - strict JSON schema (Kubernetes 1.35 + CRDs), apiVersion/kind catalog, removed APIs per target version,
   selector/port wiring.
3. **Research** - BM25 over local knowledge; results carry chunk ids, source URLs and licenses.
4. **Audit** - security, RBAC, network exposure, storage access modes vs provisioner capabilities.
5. **Calibrate** - probes, resources, replicas, PDBs, topology spread, HPA prerequisites.
6. **Generate** - deterministic generator (blueprints) or mechanical fixer (existing YAML) with a change log.
7. **Red Team** - nine adversarial scenarios evaluated on the final output; remaining HIGH/CRITICAL findings mark the
   result `blocked`.

## Trust boundaries

- MCP clients and model output are untrusted input: every tool validates with Pydantic, YAML is size/alias bounded.
  Text that came from outside is untrusted on the way out too: `kube_noob.sanitize` cleans every MCP result (invisible
  characters, role and tool-call markers, instruction phrases, exfiltrating Markdown) and flags it `untrusted`.
  Pasted payloads are data too: an Alertmanager payload is read as JSON only (2 MB, 500 alerts, 64 labels, 2,000
  characters per value, control characters dropped), and only an OpenShift release label sets the version.
- The HTTP transport authenticates with a bearer token (constant time) unless bound to loopback (sidecar).
- REST routes (`kube_noob.server.rest`, `/v1/...`) sit beside MCP on the same app and run the same toolkit call
  (`mcp_app.run_tool`: validation, sanitising, `knowledgeAsOf`, the content-free audit line, now with `via=rest`).
  Trust boundary: the caller holding the token. They pass the bearer check and body limit first, then the MCP
  transport's Host and Origin checks; a POST must be `application/json`, so a cross-site form cannot reach a tool.
  Only the tools the shared server offers have routes. `docs/api/openapi.json` is generated from the tools' models
  (`scripts/gen_openapi.py`) and a test keeps it equal to the code.
- Outbound HTTP only through `kube_noob.net`: web purpose requires `webEnabled` and allowlisted HTTPS hosts on every
  hop, GET only; `web_fetch` refuses non-text content types before reading the body. LLM and in-cluster API clients
  are separate, explicit purposes.
- The admin lock (`offline: true`) is applied at config load and only tightens: it disables web, refuses corpus
  downloads and allows only loopback or `*.svc` model endpoints. `kube-noob doctor` reports the result.
- Cluster access is read-only, allowlisted per resource, never Secrets, and redacts values before they reach a model.
  Diagnoses list read-only steps first; commands that execute or change state are labelled as needing approval.
  A structured playbook ties each root cause to the patterns that point at it, its own read-only steps and fixes
  (`debug.playbooks.Cause`, `debug.diagnose.likely_cause`); with no pattern matching, the first cause is shown.
  Names in steps come only from command-shaped input (`pod/<name>`, `kubectl get svc <name>`, `Selector:` lines) and
  are pasted into a command only when made of characters a shell leaves alone there, so a copied step only ever reads.
- Anything beyond reading is a capability tier (`kube_noob.tiers`: probe, dry-run, external writes, gate forwarding),
  off by default. Code that changes something is a `Writer` that cannot be built while its tier is off, and each
  action needs a person's `Approval` for that action, unexpired and used once. The read-only backends have no write
  method; tier RBAC renders only when the tier is on.
- A memory repository (`kube_noob.memory`) is the team's own Git content: kube-noob reads it locally, writes only on
  `memory init`, `add`, `outcome` and `migrate-learning` (new files created exclusively, rewrites atomic), never runs
  git, and never bundles, publishes or exports it. Entries are untrusted input until `memory validate` passes:
  bounded YAML, content rules, and the verifier on every fix (validate, audit and red team on patches; privileged
  SCC, cluster-admin, hostPath and wildcard RBAC grants fail without a recorded risk acceptance). In the chart the
  repository is mounted read-only; the git source is cloned by an init container (no credentials in the URL, a
  deploy key from a Secret, strict host keys), with egress only to the git host's CIDRs and, under the offline
  lock, only from an in-cluster host.
- The Red Hat Jira copy is local data that is not redistributable. Each sync appends status, resolution and
  fix-version changes to `jira/changes.jsonl` (owner-only, atomic, capped); reconciliation reads it and the ticket
  index offline. A snapshot (`corpus jira-snapshot`) is owner-only; `corpus import` validates its file names,
  sizes, checksums and that it comes from the same Jira before copying anything. `serve` imports a seed from
  `<dataDir>/seed/` only when there is no copy, and the chart mounts the seed read-only (an init container copies it
  from a pinned image, or a read-only claim). The scheduled main copy leaves the runner only encrypted.
- A sealed Jira seed is opened in the server container only, with the key file from a Secret; the init container
  that copies it never sees the key. The plaintext is written to a temporary folder next to the data, imported
  through the same validation as any snapshot, and removed; a wrong key leaves the data folder untouched.
- The public `kube-noob-db` bundle is the only data kube-noob publishes. It is built from redistributable sources
  only, checked by `corpus db-check` (allow-listed licenses, no Jira data, every file listed and checksummed), and
  shipped in an image the chart pins by digest. The init container copies the archive into a scratch volume that the
  server mounts read-only; `serve` validates the whole archive and imports it only when it is newer than the copy
  it has. Trust boundary: the image registry and its signature, checked by the operator with `cosign verify`.
- The attack-path scan (`posture scan`, tools `posture_scan` and `cluster_posture_scan`) reads RBAC objects (who may do what, no credentials) and the objects that expose and run pods; Secret objects in a bundle are dropped before analysis, and the live allowlist refuses Secrets. It reports paths and fixes and changes nothing.
- Build analytics (`kube_noob.build.analytics`) reads run folders on disk; JUnit XML with a DOCTYPE or entities is refused before parsing, and every file is size-bounded. `kube_noob.build.github_history` is the only code that reads the GitHub token: through `net.Purpose.CI` (on only with `ci.githubEnabled`, GET only, https to the configured API host and port only, no redirects), with a random pause between requests; the Claude plugin does not ship it.
- The CI gate (`kube_noob.gate`) is offline: it reads the files it is given (and runs `helm template` for `--chart`, with a throwaway Helm home), audits them together so rules that need other objects still work, maps each finding back to its file and line (or chart template), and writes SARIF, Markdown and code quality JSON. The GitHub Action installs kube-noob from its own source with hash-pinned dependencies and a hash-pinned build backend and passes every input through the environment; the Tekton Task mounts the source read-only and passes params through the environment.
- Build insight (`kube_noob.build`) reads text and files the user gives it and runs nothing: logs are split into steps by each CI system's own markers and classified by bounded patterns; the Containerfile audit parses without running a shell; the OCI layout reader opens blobs only by validated digest, refuses symlinks, checks every blob's sha256, reads layers as tar streams in memory with byte, file and layer budgets, and reports credentials by kind and location only (never their value). Trust boundary: the files on disk.
- Vulnerability assessment (`kube_noob.vuln`) reads scanner reports, SBOMs, CSAF VEX and the KEV catalog the user gives it, as bounded JSON, and runs and fetches nothing; VEX statements come from the local `redhat-vex` corpus shard or files on disk, RHACS image scans only through the Central reader (`rhacs.enabled`, GET `/v1/images/<digest>` with the same guards as policies). The threat model reads manifests through the attack-path inventory, so Secret objects are dropped unread. The Claude plugin ships the parsers and the CSAF reader (`kube_noob.vuln.csaf`), not the VEX fetcher or archive reader. Trust boundary: the scanner, SBOM and VEX producers. kube-noob trusts Red Hat's VEX statements for Red Hat builds and cites them; it does not let a report clear its own findings (CycloneDX analysis needs `--trust-report-vex`), escapes report text before it reaches the job summary, and flattens control characters in every name it reads.
- The admission webhook (`kube_noob.admission`, `kube-noob admission serve`, chart `admission.enabled`) receives the AdmissionReview requests the API server sends it over TLS (its rules never match Secrets or ConfigMaps), evaluates the object with the audit engine in memory and answers with warnings, or a denial for a rule in `admission.enforce`. It never mutates, keeps only request counters and latency buckets (`/metrics`), and connects to nothing; with `admission.lookups` a background thread lists PodDisruptionBudgets, NetworkPolicies, PersistentVolumeClaims, HorizontalPodAutoscalers and StorageClasses read-only, with jittered pauses, and a request never waits for it. Any error admits the object with a warning (fail open, like its `failurePolicy: Ignore`). Trust boundary: the API server is the only intended caller; port 8443 is open to every source by default because the API server is rarely a pod a NetworkPolicy can name, which is safe because a caller learns only the findings of an object it sends (with lookups, also whether its namespace has a matching budget or policy); `admission.networkPolicy.from` narrows it.
- Must-gather ingest (`kube_noob.mustgather.ingest`) reads a directory with `os.walk` (no links followed, files opened with `O_NOFOLLOW`, only regular files) or a tar archive as a stream (`tarfile` mode `r|*`, never `extract`), in memory, under caps on file count, bytes processed, file size, memory kept and depth. Trust boundary: the must-gather is untrusted; a traversal member refuses the archive, Secrets-named files are never opened, and member names with control characters are skipped.
- Must-gather analysers (`kube_noob.mustgather.analyse`) read only what ingest kept. Resource YAML is parsed with
  libyaml after an event pre-scan (libyaml's event parser keeps an explicit stack; its composer recurses and crashes
  the process on very deep input) that refuses aliases, more than 10 documents and nesting deeper than 64, under a
  768 MiB parse budget. Trust boundary: everything in the must-gather is untrusted; shown strings are flattened and
  redacted, names reach next-step commands only when they are valid Kubernetes names, and the output is bounded
  (150 findings per analyser, 500 in all, 25 event reasons).
- Must-gather report (`kube_noob.mustgather.report`) matches the 20 most severe findings against the bundled known
  issues (and the local Jira cache) for the detected version and against approved team memory, offline. It writes
  `report.md`, `report.json` and `case-draft.md` into the directory given (never through a symbolic link). Trust
  boundary: as for the analysers; the report adds only indexed facts, the draft leaves every human fact as a
  placeholder, and the must-gather's own path is reduced to its file name.
- MCP `analyze_must_gather` (toolkit) reads a path the caller names. Trust boundary: the caller. The local stdio
  server runs as the user and reads any absolute path; a shared (HTTP) server offers the tool only with
  `mustGather.allowedDir` and refuses a path whose resolved form (links followed) leaves it. The modules are guarded
  out of the Claude plugin.
- Code findings (`kube_noob.code`) read SARIF, Containerfiles, manifests, scanner reports and dependency files as bounded text and run nothing: no analysis engine, no package resolution, no network. The CLI reads the Containerfiles, `.dockerignore` and dependency files under `--repo` (no symlinks followed, at most 500 dependency files of 5 MB); the MCP tool takes everything inline and reads no files. Trust boundary: the SAST tools and scanners; kube-noob trusts their findings, never their paths (a path outside the source root, or one that decodes to control characters, is reported as unresolved, not opened, and its shipping counts as unknown, which gates like shipped code). Containerfile and context paths resolve inside `--repo` (the gate: the working directory) and become repository-relative; stage traversal is memoised and SARIF merging is indexed, so input inside the bounds costs linear work; dependency patterns never run on lines over 4 KB.
- The RHACS comparison (`kube_noob.rhacs`) reads a policy export as data and changes nothing. Reading Central goes through `net.Purpose.RHACS`: on only with `rhacs.enabled`, GET only, https to the configured host and port only, no redirects, the token from `$ROX_API_TOKEN` (or the KUBE_NOOB_* variable `rhacs.tokenEnv` names) in the Authorization header and never in an error; `kube_noob.rhacs_central` is the only code that reads it, and the Claude plugin does not ship it, Central's CA from `rhacs.caFile`; under the offline lock only a loopback or `*.svc` Central with no proxy from the environment. Trust boundary: Central and the token's role.
- Drift snapshots and reports (`kube_noob.drift`) are local files, owner-only, with hashes and names only: a snapshot cannot be turned back into configuration. The daily job reads through the same read-only allowlist.
- `policy generate` (CLI and the read-only `policy_generate` tool) only writes YAML: it applies nothing, reads no
  cluster and fetches nothing. What the policies do is decided by the person who applies them; enforce mode refuses
  requests, so the default is audit. The CEL reads only the admitted object and the requester's name, never other
  objects, and exempts platform namespaces and operators so a cluster upgrade is never blocked by a generated policy.
- `<dataDir>/learning.json` holds user-confirmed summaries, the user's profile and id counters only. Notes are indexed
  as `origin: local`, are never redistributable and never exported as training data.
- Evaluation (maintainer tools, not shipped in the package or plugin): `scripts/eval_questions.py` reads a question
  CSV that is third-party text (forum posts, accepted answers, Jira resolutions) from outside the repository, runs
  each row through `insight` offline and writes ids, answer kinds, finding ids and scores only: no question or answer
  text. Only ids, verdicts, retired ids and aggregates are committed (`docs/evals/`). `scripts/eval_golden.py`
  reads `tests/fixtures/golden/`, original questions written from the official docs with their source pinned to a
  commit, and fails CI when a passing item regresses. Trust boundary: the CSV is untrusted input, read with a bounded
  field size; nothing from it is executed.
