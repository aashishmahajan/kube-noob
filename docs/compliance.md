# Compliance: FedRAMP High and NIST SP 800-53

kube-noob is software that runs inside your system boundary; it is not a cloud service and holds no FedRAMP
authorization of its own. FedRAMP authorizes cloud service offerings, so kube-noob counts as a component of the
offering it runs in (for example an OpenShift or ROSA cluster in a FedRAMP High environment), and the controls below
are met by how that offering deploys and operates it. This page says what kube-noob gives as evidence, how to deploy
it inside a High boundary, and what is not covered yet. Researched 2026-10-27.

FedRAMP is changing: the Consolidated Rules for 2026 apply to every authorization from 1 January 2027, and the
Vulnerability Detection and Response rules from 7 December 2026 for obtaining and for maintaining a certification,
with a grace period to 7 March 2027. 20x Class D (the high-impact class) is not in pilot yet: RFC-0033 proposes the
Phase 4 pilot for FY27 Q1 and Q2, with the application window 1-4 December 2026 and a cap of ten participants, and
applicants need a CR26-compliant Class C certification first (checked 2026-10-31).
Both Rev5 baselines and the 20x Key Security Indicators are written against NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls, which is
what kube-noob maps to.

## Evidence kube-noob produces

| Evidence | Controls it supports | How |
|---|---|---|
| Every audit finding names the NIST SP 800-53 controls it is evidence about; each report has a `controlSummary` | CM-6, CM-7, AC-6, SC-7, SC-8, IA-5(7) and the rest in the table below | `kube-noob audit -f k8s/ --format json` (also over MCP) |
| Changes are validated before they reach the cluster | CM-3(2) | `kube-noob audit` in CI (exit 1 on high findings), `fix`, `protocol` |
| Posture: what the process can reach, and FIPS mode | CM-7, SC-7, SC-13 | `kube-noob doctor` (exit 1 on a contradiction); `config_status` over MCP |
| Policy denials and NetworkPolicy reachability explained | AC-4, SC-7, AC-3 | `kube-noob policy explain`, `kube-noob policy reach` |
| Signed image and chart, build provenance, image SBOM, hash-pinned dependencies | SI-7, SR-4, SR-11, SA-10 | Release workflow; verification commands in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) |
| Dependency and code scanning, weekly risk review | RA-5, SI-2, SA-11 | Dependabot, `pip-audit`, CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, `risk-review` workflow |
| Each requirement traced to a test | SA-11, CA-2 (input) | [guidance.md](guidance.md) |

## Deploying inside a FedRAMP High boundary

| Control | Setting |
|---|---|
| CM-7, SC-7 | Chart `config.offline=true` (no web, no corpus downloads, local models only); keep the chart's NetworkPolicy (DNS-only egress) and add the EgressFirewall on OVN-Kubernetes |
| SC-13 | Install OpenShift in FIPS mode and use the UBI-based image: kube-noob uses only SHA-256 and the system OpenSSL, so its crypto runs in the validated module. `kube-noob doctor` must show `FIPS mode on` |
| AC-3, AC-6 | Live cluster access stays off unless needed; when on it is read-only, namespace-scoped, never reads Secrets and redacts values |
| IA-2, IA-5, AC-2 | Put the HTTP service behind the OpenShift OAuth proxy backed by your PIV/CAC identity provider instead of relying only on the shared bearer token |
| AU-2, AU-3, AU-12 | Ship the container's stdout to cluster logging and your SIEM: each tool call logs the tool, argument sizes, outcome and duration, never content |
| SI-7, SR-11 | Deploy by digest from your mirror and verify the cosign signature and provenance before admission (RHACS or a Sigstore admission policy) |
| RA-5, SI-2 | Scan the image in your registry (RHACS, Quay, Clair) and fix within the Vulnerability Detection and Response timeframes; take patch releases from the weekly risk review |
| SC-28 | Keep the data directory on an encrypted storage class, or set `learningEnabled: false`; kube-noob stores nothing else |
| CM-2, CM-6 | Keep `kube-noob.yaml` in Git as a ConfigMap; run `kube-noob doctor` in the pipeline |

Using kube-noob with an AI client in a High boundary: kube-noob never calls a model. The client's model must itself
be authorized at High, for example Claude through Amazon Bedrock in AWS GovCloud (US), Claude for Government, or
Claude on Google Vertex AI with Assured Workloads, or a model you host inside the boundary (`kube-noob ask` with
`openai-compatible` and a `*.svc` endpoint).

## Not covered yet

- Per-user identity in the service: authorization is one shared token unless you add the OAuth proxy, and audit
  records do not carry the caller's identity yet.
- Machine-readable output for assessors (OSCAL assessment results) and the FedRAMP 20x Key Security Indicator
  mapping.
- FIPS mode is checked by `doctor` but not exercised in CI (no FIPS-mode runner).
- No 3PAO assessment, Iron Bank listing, DISA STIG review of the image, or CISA secure software development
  attestation has been done.
