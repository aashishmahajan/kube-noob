# Use cases

Pick your role, run the demo, then try it on your own files. Every demo runs offline in under a second and never
touches your cluster or your saved progress: `kube-noob demo --list`.

## No AI inside: three ways to use it

kube-noob is the rulebook, not the chatbot. Its audit rules, playbooks, docs index and graders give the same answer
every time, and they run where you put them.

1. **With Claude** (plugin in Claude Code or Cowork): ask in your own words and paste YAML, events or logs. Claude
   calls kube-noob's tools and explains the results. Your conversation goes to Claude as usual; kube-noob sends
   nothing.
2. **With OpenShift Lightspeed or another MCP client**: the same tools, served in your cluster
   ([openshift.md](openshift.md)). That client's model does the talking.
3. **With no AI at all**: the CLI below. Audits, diagnoses, cited search, lessons and evidence bundles need no model
   and no network, which suits CI gates and air-gapped clusters.

`kube-noob ask` is the one optional command that uses a model: one you configure, and only a local one under the
offline lock.

## Learner or trainer: practise Kubernetes objects offline

You write YAML and get graded feedback straight away. The grader uses the same rules as a production review, and it
knows the platform: an SCC rejection on OpenShift, a storage class on ROSA HCP.

```bash
kube-noob demo learn
kube-noob learn tracks
kube-noob learn lesson k8s-101-objects
kube-noob learn exercise k8s-ex-hardened-deployment
kube-noob learn submit k8s-ex-hardened-deployment -f my-answer.yaml
```

The [learning guide](learning.md) covers running a class.

## Developer: ship YAML that passes on OpenShift and ROSA HCP

```bash
kube-noob demo audit
kube-noob audit -f k8s/ --platform openshift --version 4.22
kube-noob fix -f k8s/deployment.yaml --platform openshift -o fixed.yaml
kube-noob protocol "deploy orders-api" --blueprint examples/blueprint.yaml
kube-noob helm-chart --name orders-api --namespace shop --image quay.io/acme/orders:1.4.2 --platform rosa-hcp -o charts
```

To gate pull requests, run `kube-noob audit -f k8s/ --fail-on high` in CI. It exits 1 on any HIGH or CRITICAL finding.

## SRE or on-call: diagnose before you change anything

1. Paste events, `describe` output or logs into `diagnose`: as quoted text (multi-line is fine; single quotes stop the
   shell expanding `$`), as a file with `-f`, or piped in. You get the likely cause, then read-only steps (get,
   describe, logs, events).
2. Commands that run inside a container are listed next, and changes come last. Both are marked as needing approval.

```bash
kube-noob demo diagnose
kube-noob diagnose 'Back-off restarting failed container api in pod api-1'
kube-noob diagnose -f events.txt
oc get events -n shop --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | kube-noob diagnose
kube-noob bundle deployment/orders-api -n shop --cluster-enabled
```

`bundle` writes a redacted, read-only evidence pack (`bundle.md` and `bundle.json`) that you can attach to a ticket.
Once a fix is confirmed, save it with `kube-noob learning note`. The team finds it next time as `[kn:local-N#0]`.

### Is this a known bug?

`known-issues` matches an error or symptom against the issues Red Hat lists in the OpenShift 4.20, 4.21 and 4.22 release
notes: known issues, and the issues each update fixed. You get the issue link, whether a fix exists and in which
version, the workaround, and the release-notes file it came from. Pass your version and issues already fixed there are
left out. `diagnose` runs the same check, and on a live cluster `debug` and `bundle` read the version themselves.
A match needs several rare words in common, so everyday errors such as OOMKilled never pull in an unrelated bug.

```bash
kube-noob known-issues 'could not find any suitable subnets for creating the ELB' --version 4.20.8
kube-noob diagnose -f events.txt --platform openshift --version 4.21.4
kube-noob corpus known-issues --online
```

The bundled index is dated (`kube-noob doctor` prints it, and every MCP result carries `knowledgeAsOf`);
`corpus known-issues --online` refreshes it from the release notes on GitHub.

## Platform admin: run it inside the cluster, locked down

```bash
kube-noob demo posture
helm install kube-noob deploy/helm/kube-noob --set auth.existingSecret=kube-noob-token --set config.offline=true
kube-noob doctor
```

`config.offline=true` (or `KUBE_NOOB_OFFLINE=1`) is an admin lock:

- no web, no corpus downloads, and local models only;
- nothing later in the config chain can lift it;
- the chart refuses to render if web access is also requested.

`doctor` prints what the process can reach and exits 1 if the configuration contradicts the lock. To add kube-noob
as a tool in OpenShift Lightspeed, or to run it as a sidecar, follow [openshift.md](openshift.md). Index your own
runbooks with `kube-noob corpus add-docs <folder> --source platform-runbooks`, and prove the answers on your
machine with `kube-noob selftest`.

## Security: policy-aligned reviews and red-team scenarios

Each audit finding maps to the RHACS (StackRox) policy that would fire. `redteam` shows how an attacker would use a
bundle: escape paths, lateral movement, credential exposure.

```bash
kube-noob redteam -f k8s/ --platform openshift
kube-noob explain KN-S004
```

## Claude and MCP users

Install the plugin or add the MCP server (see the [README](../README.md)), then ask for the `getting_started` prompt.
It reads your saved profile, asks for your role and platform, and suggests the first three tools to use.

## Model builders

Build the corpus, score answers with the deterministic reward and export datasets: see [training](training.md).
