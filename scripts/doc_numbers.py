"""Generate the measured numbers the documents quote, from the code that produces them.

Four of these were wrong at once on 2026-11-05, all of them the same defect `docs/compliance.md` had before
`scripts/compliance_doc.py` (G206): a number somebody typed, beside code that moved. `docs/limits.md` published
"47 generated / 31 not generated" for Kubernetes and "54 / 24" for OpenShift -- both pairs summing to 78, the rule
count this project retired, because the generated column was updated and the other was not. `docs/use-cases.md`
sold the compact report as "105 findings over 19 rules ... 118 631 to 54 694 bytes" when it was 115 over 21 and
141 349 to 69 936.

It happened again on 2026-11-06, in the one file that measures the whole product: `docs/roadmap.md` said "91
rules" and "28 of NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5's controls" the day the catalogue reached 92 and the thirtieth control
got a rule, and its "105 commands" matched no counting method at all. Those sentences are generated now too.

Four regions are rewritten and nothing else:

- the platform table in `docs/limits.md`, from `kube_noob.generate.policies.generate` for each platform the table
  lists, with its own `policy generate` header as the authority a reader can reproduce;
- the compaction sentence in `docs/use-cases.md`, from an actual audit of `examples/` and an actual compaction of
  that report;
- the "Measured <date>, not estimated" sentence in `docs/roadmap.md`, from the files and registries themselves;
- the control sentence under that file's "honest ceiling" heading, from `kube_noob.audit.controls`.

Every measurement is deterministic: fixed inputs, same bytes every run, which is what makes `--check` meaningful
rather than flaky. What each number counts, so a reader can reproduce it and a later change cannot quietly
redefine it:

- lines and modules: every `*.py` under `src/kube_noob` and under `tests`, counted as lines of text;
- rules: `audit.engine.list_rules`, the catalogue the audit actually runs;
- MCP tools: `Toolkit(load_settings()).specs()`, the same call `docs/website-updates.md` publishes;
- commands: every subcommand node in the CLI parser, at any depth (`posture` and `posture scan` are two), which
  is the only definition that does not change with how deeply a command is nested;
- chart templates: `*.yaml` under the chart's `templates/`;
- controls: the NIST controls at least one rule names (`RULE_CONTROLS`), out of the titled catalogue.
