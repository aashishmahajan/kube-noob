# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the repository's
Security tab (private vulnerability reporting). Do not open a public issue. Expect an acknowledgement within 3 business
days and a fix or mitigation plan within 30 days for confirmed issues.

## Supported versions

The latest minor release receives security fixes.

## Default posture

kube-noob makes no outbound connections and touches no cluster unless you enable it. This is tested in CI and was
verified end to end inside a network namespace with no route (docs/release-readiness.md). With web access enabled it
only performs HTTPS GETs to allowlisted documentation domains, refuses non-text content types (archives, binaries,
scripts), streams at most `web.maxBytes`, never writes the content to disk and never executes it. The admin lock
(`offline: true` / `KUBE_NOOB_OFFLINE=1`) overrides `webEnabled`, blocks corpus downloads and allows only loopback or
in-cluster model endpoints; no later configuration source can lift it. `kube-noob doctor` reports the effective
posture. The local learning file stores only user-confirmed summaries and ids, never logs, manifests or credentials. The MCP server's only subprocesses are read-only `oc`/`kubectl` calls (argv, no shell)
when cluster access is enabled; the maintainer CLI commands `corpus build --online` and `helm-audit` run `git` and
`helm template` locally.

## Security design

| Area | Control |
|---|---|
| Network | `webEnabled: false` by default; all outbound HTTP goes through one guarded client; web requests (and every redirect) must be HTTPS to an allowlisted domain. |
| Cluster access | Opt-in (`cluster.enabled`), read-only verbs on an allowlist of resources, Secrets never readable, ConfigMap values / sensitive env values / token-like log content redacted, strict argument validation, no shell. |
| HTTP server | Refuses to bind non-loopback without a bearer token (constant-time compare) unless explicitly overridden; DNS-rebinding protection with a Host allowlist; health endpoints are the only unauthenticated paths. |
| Input parsing | YAML SafeLoader only, 5 MB / 1000-document caps, alias-expansion budget against billion-laughs. |
| Prompt injection | Every MCP tool result and the knowledge resource is cleaned before it leaves the server. Removed: invisible Unicode (tags, bidi overrides, zero-width other than an emoji's joiner, soft hyphens and other word splitters), chat-template and role markers, tool-call markup, instructions aimed at a model (matched on a normalised copy: full-width and mathematical letters folded, Cyrillic and Greek look-alikes mapped, entities and colour codes decoded, hyphenated line breaks joined; English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean; inside base64), every remote image address and a link's query when it can carry data. Flagged but kept: phrases that are operations as often as attacks ("send the credentials to vault.example.com"). The result carries `untrusted: true` and the signals. Evals: 66 of 66 and 25 of 25 with no finding on 148 benign lines; the red team's 50 new attacks 48 caught and its 55 adversarial benign lines 1 altered (a remote badge image), 8 flagged; these sets were used to tune, RT2 measures blind. |
| Container | UBI 9, non-root numeric UID, works with OpenShift arbitrary UIDs, read-only root filesystem in the chart, all capabilities dropped, RuntimeDefault seccomp. |
| Supply chain | Hash-pinned dependencies (`requirements.lock`), SHA-pinned Actions, CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, Dependabot, `pip-audit` in CI, PyPI Trusted Publishing, SLSA provenance attestations, SBOM, keyless cosign signatures. |
| Data | Corpus records carry license and redistributability; Jira identities and emails are scrubbed; non-redistributable content is never published unencrypted by CI. Retention and destinations: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md). |
| Private Jira seed | Sealed with the organisation's key: AES-256-GCM per 1 MiB chunk with counter nonces and a last-chunk flag, a per-file key from PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600,000 iterations, random salt); any edit, reorder, drop, truncation or wrong key fails and nothing is written. The key comes from a mounted Secret file only (mode 0440, the server container alone). The `jira-db-image` workflow refuses a repository anyone can list and an image anyone can pull, and refuses a copy whose anonymiser self-check finds a person. |
| Public data image | `kube-noob-db` holds one archive that `corpus db-check` gates twice in CI (before the build and on the image's own copy) and again on the pushed digest: redistributable records on allow-listed licenses only, no Jira data, every file listed with its checksum, no links or special files. Published only when the maintainer enables it, attested and keyless-signed; the chart accepts it by digest only, copies it with `cp` in a read-only, capability-free init container, and `corpus import` re-validates the whole archive before copying anything. |
| Red Hat Jira sync | REST API only (no page scraping, per Atlassian's Acceptable Use Policy); one request per second or slower (robots.txt crawl delay) plus random jitter, a request budget per run, the in-cluster sync's first run after a random 30 s to 10 min and every interval +/- 10%, clones from GitHub spaced by a random pause, the scheduled refresh started at a random offset, backoff on 429 with `Retry-After`; the client can only GET from the Jira host (plus POST to its search endpoint) over HTTPS; project and issue keys are validated before they reach a query; the local ticket index is mode 0600. |
| Claude plugin | Runs the readable stdio server bundled in the plugin with `uv run --frozen --isolated`; every dependency is pinned by version and sha256 in `uv.lock`; no LLM SDK is installed and no package-manager variable is set; only the modules the stdio server imports ship, so nothing in the plugin reads a credential; web, cluster and model calls are off. |
| Sidecar | Binds 127.0.0.1 only, so only containers in the same pod can call it (the pod is the trust boundary); no Service port, no token, no egress needed. CI proves the port is closed on the pod IP. |
| Egress on OpenShift | Chart NetworkPolicy allows DNS only by default; optional OVN-Kubernetes EgressFirewall allows only the API server and allowlisted HTTPS domains, then denies all. |
| Homebrew | The formula installs the release wheel and wheels-only dependencies pinned by hash from the release's `requirements.lock`. |

## Capability tiers

kube-noob reads by default and changes nothing. Everything else is a tier, off by default; every action in a tier
needs a person's approval for exactly that action, valid for 15 minutes and usable once. `kube-noob doctor` prints
each tier and what it needs.

| Tier | Switch | Allows | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| R | `cluster.enabled` | get, list and logs on the allowlisted resources (including Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings for the attack-path scan); Secrets never | get/list/watch RBAC |
| R | `ci.githubEnabled` | GET of a repository's GitHub Actions runs, attempts and jobs, to `ci.githubApiUrl` only, no redirects | a token with `actions: read` in `$GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| R | `rhacs.enabled` | GET of RHACS Central's policies (`/v1/policies`) and of the image scans you name (`/v1/images/<digest>`, `vuln report --rhacs-image`), to `rhacs.endpoint` only, no redirects | an RHACS API token that can read policies and images (for example the Analyst role) in `$ROX_API_TOKEN` |
| P | `probe.enabled` | an ephemeral debug container or a probe Job | patch on `pods/ephemeralcontainers`; create and delete on Jobs (chart Role only when enabled) |
| D | `dryRun.enabled` | server-side dry-run (`?dryRun=All`) of a manifest | create and patch on `dryRun.rules` resources, never Secrets: Kubernetes authorizes a dry-run exactly like the real request |
| W | `itsm.writeEnabled`, `notify.enabled` | attach evidence to a ticket; forward a report | the external system's token; refused under the offline lock |
| G | `gate.enabled` | forward a tool call a person approved to an upstream MCP server | nothing from kube-noob; the upstream keeps its own access |

The read-only backends have no method that writes. Code that changes something exists only while its tier is on.
kube-noob's own audit flags what the P and D Roles allow (KN-S017, medium): pods started by Jobs or added as
ephemeral containers can act as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so enable them only in namespaces that enforce
Pod Security `restricted`.

## Compliance

Audit findings name the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls they are evidence about, and `kube-noob doctor` reports FIPS
mode. How to deploy kube-noob inside a FedRAMP High boundary, and what is not covered yet:
[docs/compliance.md](docs/compliance.md).
