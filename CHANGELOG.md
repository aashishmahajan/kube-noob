# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-27

Enterprise self-help release: safe by construction, provable in your environment, and grounded in your own runbooks.

- Admin offline lock (`offline: true`, `KUBE_NOOB_OFFLINE=1`, Helm `config.offline`): overrides `webEnabled`, blocks
  corpus downloads, allows only loopback or `*.svc` model endpoints (no redirects, no proxy environment), and no
  later config source can lift it. `kube-noob doctor` reports the posture and exits 1 on contradictions.
- Web access is HTTPS GET only to allowlisted domains and text content types only, with bounded decompression.
- Diagnose before change: read-only steps first, then container exec and cluster changes, each marked as needing
  approval; commands are paste-safe in zsh; `kube-noob bundle` writes a redacted read-only evidence pack.
- Upgrade-safe learning file (`learning.json`): stated profile, user-confirmed notes cited as `[kn:local-N#0]`,
  id-only counters; credentials, manifests and logs are rejected; cross-process file locking.
- `kube-noob corpus add-docs`: index your own runbooks offline with credentials masked.
- `kube-noob selftest`: 61 real questions across Kubernetes, Helm, OpenShift 4.22, ROSA HCP, RHACS and everyday
  errors; new knowledge (EgressIP, ROSA HCP egress zero, Ingress, DNS, DeploymentConfig migration, everyday
  errors) and four new playbooks.
- `kube-noob demo` (7 offline scenarios), VHS recordings attached to each release, MCP prompt `getting_started`,
  docs for use cases, learning, OpenShift and Lightspeed integration, and a guidance traceability table enforced
  by tests.
- Reward: a citation earns credit only when the cited chunk supports the citing sentence.
- Fixed after an independent security review: 10 findings, 33 regression tests.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-27

- First PyPI release. 0.1.0 was tagged but never reached PyPI: the pinned pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish v1.13.0 bundles twine 6.1.0, which rejects Metadata-Version 2.5 from current hatchling. Publish action bumped to v1.14.3 (twine 7.0.0) and scorecard-action to v2.5.0; CI and release now check dists with the exact twine the pinned publish action uses (scripts/check_publishable.sh).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-27

First release.
- MCP server (stdio + authenticated streamable HTTP), CLI, Claude plugin with 7 skills, Helm chart and sidecar example.
- 7-step protocol (Clarify, Validate, Research, Audit, Calibrate, Generate, Red Team).
- 60 deterministic audit rules plus strict schema validation (Kubernetes 1.35, Route, SCC, EgressFirewall, Gateway
  API, StackRox CRDs), 9 red-team scenarios, safe auto-fix, RHACS policy mapping.
- Generator for kubernetes / openshift / rosa-classic / rosa-hcp manifests and Helm charts.
- 33 debugging playbooks and read-only live cluster evidence (kubectl/oc or in-cluster ServiceAccount).
- 28 fact-checked knowledge docs (OCP 4.22 = Kubernetes 1.35, Helm 4, RHACS 4.11 -> 5.0, ROSA HCP architecture).
- Learning tracks with graded exercises, quizzes and credits.
- Corpus builder (Git docs with license provenance, release history, jittered Jira pulls), deterministic reward with
  TRL adapter, held-out benchmark, SFT/GRPO export.
- Hardened before release after an independent red-team review: assertion-gated, negation-aware reward with citation
  relevance; config never read implicitly from the working directory; LLM key/endpoint restrictions; redaction of
  credentials in every cluster string; duplicate-key and nesting-depth checks; fixer output that the API server
  accepts (privileged containers, root containers, null securityContexts, duplicate EgressFirewalls).
