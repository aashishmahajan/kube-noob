# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Roadmap rewritten to the moat program (M1 to M12): signal-keyed matching, fixes-as-code memory, must-gather
  pre-flight, network truth, verifier hardening, integrations without AI, the kube-noob gate and governance. The
  trained-model track is cut; the grader and `kube-noob train bench` stay as an evaluation product; learner tracks,
  credits and brand videos are frozen. New `docs/editions.md` records where an enterprise line could fall
  (documentation only).

- Capability tiers: probe (P), server-side dry-run (D), external writes (W) and gate forwarding (G) join read-only
  (R) as explicit switches, all off by default. `doctor` lists every tier, what it allows and what it needs, and
  reports contradictions (a probe without cluster access, a ticket write under the offline lock). Anything that
  changes something is a writer that cannot exist while its tier is off and needs a person's approval for exactly that
  action, unexpired and used once. The chart renders a probe Role and a dry-run Role only when enabled.
- KN-S017 also flags workload creation and changes (pods, Deployments, Jobs...), ephemeral containers and
  PersistentVolume creation: each lets a subject act as any ServiceAccount in the namespace or reach the host
  (Kubernetes RBAC good practices).
- `kube-noob signals` extracts the canonical names in an error: Alertmanager alert names (webhook payload or text),
  Kubernetes event reasons, ClusterOperator conditions with their reasons (YAML, JSON or `oc get co`), container
  waiting and terminated reasons, admission rules, components, and normalised error templates with a short hash.
  Vocabularies are copied from the upstream files that emit them (kubelet, scheduler, controllers, CRI-O,
  openshift/api) and cited in the code. Signals are the join key the next items use for known issues and memory.
- Signal catalogue (`kube_noob/data/signals.yaml`, 74 entries): etcd, API server, node, workload, OpenShift
  platform (ClusterOperators, cluster version, machine config, ingress, OVN-Kubernetes) alerts plus event and
  container reasons, each with the phrases people use for it, search terms, components, playbooks and the upstream
  rule file it comes from. Where OpenShift names differ from upstream both are listed (etcdGRPCReadRequestsSlow and
  etcdGRPCWriteRequestsSlow next to etcdGRPCRequestsSlow; the machine-config alert is MCCDrainError).
- Known-issue matching uses signals: the query adds the terms of the alerts, event and container reasons the text
  carries or implies ("leader changed" for etcd leader elections), and words meet their light stems ("draining"
  meets "drain"). A match still needs rare words from the text itself. New frozen eval
  `data/evals/known_issue_recall.yaml` (51 symptoms written as prose, firing alerts and event lines; 33 everyday
  errors that must never match) gates recall at 0.8 and false matches at zero: recall went from 36/50 (one false
  match) to 48/51 (none). `kube-noob known-issues 'etcd leader changed frequently, apiserver timeouts after
  upgrade' --version 4.21.0` now finds OCPBUGS-73881 (4.20.5 finds OCPBUGS-73876; 4.21.2 and 4.20.13, which carry
  the fixes, find nothing).
- Signals everywhere: `diagnose`, `debug` and `bundle` list the signals they read (alert names, event, condition
  and container reasons, admission rules, components) and rank playbooks with them; `policy explain` lists the
  admission signals. `diagnose -f alert.json` takes an Alertmanager webhook payload (or the API's alert list) as it
  is: each alert is read as text, known issues are matched on each alert's line and summary, and an
  `openshift_version` or `version` label that names an OpenShift 4 release picks the issues for that version. New
  read-only MCP tool `kubenoob_extract_signals`; `kube-noob signals` also prints the alerts a text implies and the
  playbooks they point at.
- New playbook DBG-ETCD (39 in all): leader changes, slow disk (WAL fsync and backend commit latency), no leader,
  members down and the database space alarm, with read-only checks for OpenShift and kubeadm clusters, from the etcd
  FAQ and maintenance guide and the OpenShift etcd procedures. Every etcd alert in the catalogue points at it.
- Fixes-as-code memory, entry format: one reviewed YAML file per lesson (`entries/MEM-<n>.yaml`) with signals,
  symptom, platform, introduced and fixed versions, operator ranges, cause, fix (text, optional patch, commands),
  evidence references, outcomes per cluster, owners, sources, dates and an optional risk acceptance. A Pydantic
  model and a JSON Schema (`kube_noob/data/memory/entry.schema.json`) ship in the package. Prose is a summary
  (credentials, raw logs, event rows, stack traces, pipelines and manifests are rejected), a command carries the
  label the playbook classifier gives it and never prints a Secret, a patch holds manifests but never a Secret,
  evidence is a URL, ticket key, citation or bundle path, and versions must be quoted.
- `kube-noob memory`: `init` scaffolds a team memory repository (README, schema, `entries/`, a GitHub Actions
  workflow and a shell script that run `validate`); `add` writes a proposed entry with the next id and never commits;
  `validate` is the poisoning guard (schema, duplicates, review dates, credentials anywhere in a file, and the
  verifier: patches are validated, audited and red-teamed, and privileged SCC, cluster-admin, hostPath and wildcard
  RBAC grants fail unless the entry records an unexpired `riskAccepted`); `match` takes text or an Alertmanager
  payload, matches approved entries on signals first and distinctive words second, shows negative entries as "tried,
  did not work" and entries fixed in your version as retired, with "matched N times, resolved M"; `outcome`, `stats
  --by cluster|signal|component` and `migrate-learning`. New demo: `kube-noob demo memory`.
- Faster on long input: search walks each distinct query word's postings instead of every chunk for every word
  (scores unchanged), so a 100 KB repetitive error no longer costs seconds in known-issue matching; JSON input is
  parsed as JSON only, and each playbook pattern scans the text once.
- Memory in every runtime: `memory.paths` in the config (or `KUBE_NOOB_MEMORY_PATHS`) is read by the CLI, the
  stdio MCP server and the HTTP server; `kube-noob doctor` lists each repository with its entry counts and warns
  about one it cannot read; `memory match` uses the paths when `--dir` is not given. Chart: `memory.source`
  `configMap`, `pvc` or `git` mounts the repository read-only at `/srv/kube-noob/memory`; the git source clones it in
  an init container (https:// or ssh:// with a deploy-key Secret, never credentials in the URL), opens egress only to
  `memory.git.egressCIDRs`, names the host in the EgressFirewall, and under `config.offline` accepts only an
  in-cluster host.
- Fixed: redaction was quadratic on long dashed tokens (a 240 KB "a-a-a-..." line took over two minutes in
  `diagnose`, `policy explain` and log redaction); the flag-name prefix is now bounded and the case is a regression
  test.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-28

Has Red Hat seen this error before? A local copy of Red Hat's public Jira, and what became of each ticket.

- `kube-noob corpus jira --online` copies every ticket of the chosen projects, whatever its status: by default the
  28 OpenShift, ROSA, ACM and RHACS projects (OCPBUGS, ROX, HOSTEDCP, CNV, OSSM, LOG...), or `--projects all` or a
  list. `corpus jira-projects --online` lists what Red Hat's Jira shows (292 public projects on 2026-10-28).
- Supported interfaces only: projects from `/rest/api/3/project/search` and tickets from `/rest/api/3/search/jql`,
  never the web pages (Atlassian's Acceptable Use Policy forbids scraping). One request per second or slower (the
  site's robots.txt crawl delay) plus jitter, backoff on 429 honouring `Retry-After`, and a request budget per run
  (`--max-requests`, `jira.maxRequests`, default 600). Later runs fetch only what changed (`updated >= -Nm`) and
  resume a stopped backfill by key.
- `known-issues`, `diagnose`, `debug`, `bundle` and the incident watch now say what became of a matching ticket: fixed
  (in which release, and whether the cluster's version already has it), fix merged or proposed, open, or closed as
  Not a Bug, Won't Do, Cannot Reproduce, Obsolete or as a duplicate (followed to the original), with the workaround,
  cause or "why closed" sentence from the latest comments. Matches need rare shared words or a distinctive error line
  found word for word, so generic errors never pull in a ticket. SQLite FTS5 index: about 50 ms per lookup over
  100,000 tickets.
- Fix versions are compared with the cluster's version only for projects that ship OpenShift releases (OCPBUGS, OKD,
  HOSTEDCP, USHIFT); operators with their own version lines (OADP 1.4, Logging 5.9...) and RHACS are never called
  "already fixed in your version". Kubernetes status words and everyday English never count as evidence, so pasted
  `describe` output in a few tickets cannot make CrashLoopBackOff or OOMKilled match one.
- `kube-noob ticket OCPBUGS-12345 --version 4.21.1` and the MCP tool `kubenoob_ticket` look up one ticket.
- Upgrading from 0.4: the version-filtered ROX copy that `corpus jira` wrote before is refreshed by the first full
  sync; an imported copy resumes where it ends.
- The service can keep the copy current: `jira.sync.enabled` in the chart (needs persistence and one replica; opens
  egress 443, and the EgressFirewall allows redhat.atlassian.net only).
- Tickets are public but not redistributable: they stay in the data directory, are never in the package, plugin or
  dataset exports, and CI uploads them only encrypted. Reporter, assignee and comment authors are never stored.
- Release-note issue links point at redhat.atlassian.net (Red Hat's Jira moved to Atlassian Cloud).
- Ticket shards no longer load into the general search index; they have their own.
- Chart fix found by kube-noob's own audit (KN-ST002): with `persistence.enabled` and the default ReadWriteOnce volume,
  the Deployment now uses the Recreate strategy and refuses `replicaCount` above 1. A rolling update's surge pod, or a
  second replica, on another node hung in ContainerCreating with a Multi-Attach error.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-27

An incident watch that remembers: always on, read-only, no model.

- `kube-noob watch -n <namespace>` (and `watch.enabled` in the chart, `kube-noob serve --watch`): polls pods,
  events, deployments and replicasets with get and list only, and groups what it finds into incidents by namespace,
  workload and signal: CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, container config errors, FailedCreate (with the
  policy that denied it), Unschedulable, FailedMount, failing probes, stuck rollouts and evictions.
- Each new or recurring incident is explained once: the matching playbook, the policy denial, reported OpenShift
  issues, and what changed in the Deployment's last rollout (image, environment variable names, resources) when it
  started soon after.
- The incident ledger (`incidents.json` in the data directory) keeps occurrences, durations and the fixes a person
  confirmed (`kube-noob incidents confirm`); a recurrence comes back with the last confirmed fix, and the same problem
  in another workload shows it too. It never stores log lines, object specs or Secret values (PRIVACY.md).
- MCP tools `kubenoob_incidents`, `kubenoob_incident`, `kubenoob_incident_confirm` (not on shared HTTP servers) and,
  with cluster access, `kubenoob_cluster_check_namespace`. CI runs the watch on kind against a crash loop and a
  Pod Security denial.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-10-27

Why was this denied, and can pod A reach pod B? Policy debugging, offline and read-only.

- `kube-noob policy explain` and the MCP tool `kubenoob_explain_denial`: explain a denial policy by policy for Kyverno
  (including rules Kyverno generates for Deployments and other controllers), OPA Gatekeeper (deny and warn),
  ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, Pod Security Admission, OpenShift SCC (which fields restricted-v2 rejected, the
  namespace UID range, which SCCs the ServiceAccount may not use), RHACS (policy, violations, remediation), ResourceQuota
  (what is left), LimitRange and RBAC. Each comes with read-only commands with the names filled in, the change that
  satisfies the policy, the audit rules that catch it before deploy, and, for Pod Security and RBAC, a patch: the
  restricted securityContext, or a Role and RoleBinding for exactly the missing verb and resource. Exceptions, quota
  increases and new permissions are marked as the policy owner's decision.
- `diagnose`, `debug` and `bundle` add `policyDenials` when the text holds a denial.
- `kube-noob policy reach` and the MCP tools `kubenoob_check_network_policy` (manifests) and
  `kubenoob_cluster_check_traffic` (live, read-only): evaluate NetworkPolicies for a connection (pod selectors,
  namespace selectors, matchExpressions, ipBlock with except, named ports, endPort, default policyTypes), name the
  policy and rule that decide egress and ingress, say for every other rule whether the peer or the port missed, and
  propose the smallest NetworkPolicy that allows exactly that traffic (tests apply it and re-check). Exits 1 when
  denied, for CI. AdminNetworkPolicy, EgressFirewall and CNI-specific policies are reported as not evaluated.
- `examples/netpol-shop.yaml`: a default-deny namespace with an allowed and a blocked path, for trying `policy reach`.
- Compliance: every audit finding names the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls it is evidence about (all 60 rules
  mapped), reports add a `controlSummary`, and `kube-noob explain` shows the control titles. `kube-noob doctor`
  reports FIPS mode (kernel flag and OpenSSL). `docs/compliance.md`: how to run kube-noob inside a FedRAMP High
  boundary, control by control, and what is not covered yet.
- Homebrew CI: right after a release, the public-tap check waits for PyPI's index to show the new version (it is
  cached for a few minutes) instead of failing; it still fails when PyPI has a newer version than the formula.
- Red-team hardening for both: names that reach a copy-paste command (policy, binding, namespace, subject, labels)
  must match Kubernetes syntax, so a log or manifest cannot smuggle `;`, `$(...)` or a newline into one; terminal
  escape sequences are dropped from text output; every pattern is bounded so hostile 200 KB input stays fast.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-27

Is this a known bug? kube-noob now answers from the OpenShift release notes, and says how current its knowledge is.

- `kube-noob known-issues` and the MCP tool `kubenoob_known_issues`: match an error or symptom against 957 issues
  from the OpenShift 4.20, 4.21 and 4.22 release notes (known issues, and the issues each update fixed), each with
  its Red Hat issue link, fix version, workaround and the release-notes file it came from. With `--version`, issues
  already fixed in that version are left out. A match needs at least three words that are rare both among the issues
  and in general Kubernetes writing, so everyday errors (OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, SCC denials) never match an
  unrelated bug; tests hold both directions.
- `diagnose`, `debug` and `bundle` add `knownIssues`; on a live cluster they read the Kubernetes and OpenShift
  versions (`cluster_version` also reports when the cluster is newer than kube-noob's knowledge).
- Every MCP result carries `knowledgeAsOf`, `doctor` prints it, and web lookups are marked as external and newer than
  the built-in knowledge.
- `kube-noob corpus known-issues --online` refreshes the index from github.com/openshift/openshift-docs;
  `scripts/vendor_known_issues.py` refreshes the bundled copy (every file under 256 KiB).
- README: the playbook count is 38 (it said 33); a test now keeps the README's counts in step with the code.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-10-27

Install fixes: the Homebrew formula is kept in step by the release and tested the way users install it; a short
`noob` command; an install guide with the fix for each common error.

- `noob` is a short form of `kube-noob`: every install method (pip, pipx, uv, Homebrew) puts both commands on
  `PATH`. The Homebrew formula links `noob` from this release on and its test runs `noob --version`.
- PyPI shows the install guide (`docs/install.md`) under the project links, and the README there starts with the
  Homebrew commands.
- Homebrew: the formula was brought up to 0.2.2. The release workflow now writes it once PyPI has the new version and pushes it to
  main, and a new CI job installs it exactly as documented (`brew tap aashishmahajan/kube-noob
  https://github.com/aashishmahajan/kube-noob`, `brew trust --formula aashishmahajan/kube-noob/kube-noob`, then
  `brew install kube-noob`) on macOS and Linux and fails if the installed version differs from the formula or from
  PyPI. Homebrew 6 refuses formulae from third-party taps until they are trusted, so the trust step is required.
- `docs/install.md`: every install method with its upgrade command, and the fix for each common error (no tap, Python
  older than 3.11, `externally-managed-environment`, no `pip` command, an older copy earlier on `PATH`).
- Demo copy and the sidecar video show 0.2.2; the roadmap adds known-issue matching, policy debugging and a proposed
  trained-model track for OpenShift.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-10-27

The Claude plugin passes the plugin directory's checks; releases finish even when the chart push fails; three
animated videos rendered without a video model.

- Claude plugin: `.mcp.json` sets no package-manager variable; the server runs with `uv run --frozen --isolated`
  (a throwaway environment in uv's cache, nothing written to the plugin folder). The plugin ships only the modules
  the stdio server imports: no CLI, model agent, HTTP service or cluster backend, and no code that names or reads a
  credential. Every file is UTF-8 text under 256 KiB (the Kubernetes schema ships as plain JSON parts instead of
  gzip), and `plugin.json` keeps only fields the plugin reference defines. Tests and the sync check enforce all of it.
- Learning notes reject any command pipeline (`|`); describe a fix in words.
- `llm.apiKeyEnv` and `server.authTokenEnv` default to unset; the model client and the HTTP service fall back to
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `KUBE_NOOB_HTTP_TOKEN` as before, and `apiKeyEnv` is still validated when the configuration
  loads.
- Release: the chart push to GHCR and its cosign signature run in their own job (cosign now logs in to GHCR itself),
  so a registry problem no longer blocks the GitHub release; each step reports its error as an annotation.
- Homebrew formula updated to 0.2.1 (43 hash-checked wheels, no LLM SDK).
- `demos/video/stage`: the teaser, sidecar and MCP videos in the look of the Grok teaser, with a Piper voice-over
  (LibriTTS voice, CC BY 4.0), generated music and terminal lines copied from real runs.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-10-27

No AI inside, said and enforced; safer to run for a whole team; easier to install.

- No AI inside, said plainly: README, plugin, docs and video copy explain that Claude, OpenShift Lightspeed or any MCP
  client does the talking and kube-noob supplies deterministic tools; only the optional `kube-noob ask` calls a model.
  A test keeps copy from calling kube-noob an AI, assistant or agent.
- The Claude plugin runs the readable server source bundled in `plugin/kube-noob/server` with every dependency pinned
  by hash in `uv.lock` (`uv run --frozen`), installs no LLM SDK, keeps its environment in the plugin data folder, and
  reports no model in its posture. CI checks the copy, the lock, a vulnerability audit and an end-to-end start.
- PRIVACY.md lists what kube-noob reads, stores and sends, per destination; the plugin manifest links it.
- No model is configured by default (`llm.provider: none`); the Anthropic SDK moved to the optional
  `kube-noob[ask]` extra, so the core install, the image, the plugin and Homebrew carry no LLM SDK.
- `kube-noob diagnose` takes the error text itself: quoted, as `-f "<text>"`, from a file or from stdin.
- Security, from a second red-team review: tool failures never log the caller's content; the HTTP token is checked
  before any body is read; caller-supplied grading patterns are literal text (no regex denial of service); HTTP
  servers do not offer learning-file writes; notes reject download-and-run commands and log lines; the plugin runs
  Python isolated (`-I -B`); `kube-noob --config X <command>` is honoured (it was ignored, failing open).
- Chart: generated bearer token when none is given (lints clean for the OpenShift Helm catalog), RBAC limited to
  the release namespace plus `rbac.namespaces` by default, web egress only to public addresses or a set proxy,
  optional OVN-Kubernetes EgressFirewall, and an OCI chart signed with cosign on every release.
- OpenShift 4.20, 4.21, 4.22 and the newest Kubernetes in CI (kind with Pod Security restricted), including the
  sidecar example; sizing measured (`scripts/measure_footprint.py`) and documented with retention and egress.
- Homebrew formula (Apple silicon and Linux) built offline from hash-checked wheels.
- Diagnose and search: client-side x509, RBAC subject, nginx permission errors, kubectl for `--platform
  kubernetes`, scheduling and TLS knowledge; the protocol reads "OpenShift 4.21" from the request.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-27

Enterprise self-help release: safe by construction, provable in your environment, and grounded in your own runbooks.

- Admin offline lock (`offline: true`, `KUBE_NOOB_OFFLINE=1`, Helm `config.offline`): overrides `webEnabled`, blocks
  corpus downloads, allows only loopback or `*.svc` model endpoints (no redirects, no proxy environment), and no
  later config source can lift it. `kube-noob doctor` reports the posture and exits 1 on contradictions.
- Web access is HTTPS GET only to allowlisted domains and text content types only, with bounded decompression.
- Diagnose before change: read-only steps first, then container exec and cluster changes, each marked as needing
  approval; commands are paste-safe in zsh; `kube-noob bundle` writes a redacted read-only evidence pack.
- Upgrade-safe learning file (`learning.json`): stated profile, user-confirmed notes cited as `[kn:local-N#0]`,
  id-only counters; credentials, manifests and logs are rejected; cross-process file locking.
- `kube-noob corpus add-docs`: index your own runbooks offline with credentials masked.
- `kube-noob selftest`: 61 real questions across Kubernetes, Helm, OpenShift 4.22, ROSA HCP, RHACS and everyday
  errors; new knowledge (EgressIP, ROSA HCP egress zero, Ingress, DNS, DeploymentConfig migration, everyday
  errors) and four new playbooks.
- `kube-noob demo` (7 offline scenarios), VHS recordings attached to each release, MCP prompt `getting_started`,
  docs for use cases, learning, OpenShift and Lightspeed integration, and a guidance traceability table enforced
  by tests.
- Reward: a citation earns credit only when the cited chunk supports the citing sentence.
- Fixed after an independent security review: 10 findings, 33 regression tests.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-27

- First PyPI release. 0.1.0 was tagged but never reached PyPI: the pinned pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish v1.13.0 bundles twine 6.1.0, which rejects Metadata-Version 2.5 from current hatchling. Publish action bumped to v1.14.3 (twine 7.0.0) and scorecard-action to v2.5.0; CI and release now check dists with the exact twine the pinned publish action uses (scripts/check_publishable.sh).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-27

First release.
- MCP server (stdio + authenticated streamable HTTP), CLI, Claude plugin with 7 skills, Helm chart and sidecar example.
- 7-step protocol (Clarify, Validate, Research, Audit, Calibrate, Generate, Red Team).
- 60 deterministic audit rules plus strict schema validation (Kubernetes 1.35, Route, SCC, EgressFirewall, Gateway
  API, StackRox CRDs), 9 red-team scenarios, safe auto-fix, RHACS policy mapping.
- Generator for kubernetes / openshift / rosa-classic / rosa-hcp manifests and Helm charts.
- 33 debugging playbooks and read-only live cluster evidence (kubectl/oc or in-cluster ServiceAccount).
- 28 fact-checked knowledge docs (OCP 4.22 = Kubernetes 1.35, Helm 4, RHACS 4.11 -> 5.0, ROSA HCP architecture).
- Learning tracks with graded exercises, quizzes and credits.
- Corpus builder (Git docs with license provenance, release history, jittered Jira pulls), deterministic reward with
  TRL adapter, held-out benchmark, SFT/GRPO export.
- Hardened before release after an independent red-team review: assertion-gated, negation-aware reward with citation
  relevance; config never read implicitly from the working directory; LLM key/endpoint restrictions; redaction of
  credentials in every cluster string; duplicate-key and nesting-depth checks; fixer output that the API server
  accepts (privileged containers, root containers, null securityContexts, duplicate EgressFirewalls).
