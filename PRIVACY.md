# Privacy

kube-noob is open-source software that you run yourself: on your computer, in your CI, or in your cluster. The
maintainers run no service and receive nothing from it. There are no accounts, no telemetry and no analytics.

There is no AI inside kube-noob. When you use it from Claude, OpenShift Lightspeed or another MCP client, that client
and its model do the talking and call kube-noob's tools. What you share in that conversation is handled by that
product under its own terms and privacy policy. kube-noob adds no network traffic of its own.

## What it reads

- Text you give it: manifests, events, logs, error messages and questions. It processes them in memory to answer.
- Its bundled knowledge, and documents you index yourself with `kube-noob corpus add-docs`.
- Only if you turn on cluster access: read-only requests to the Kubernetes or OpenShift API of your current
  kubeconfig context. It never reads Secrets and redacts values that look like credentials.

## What it stores, on your machine only

Everything lives in the data directory: `~/.local/share/kube-noob` by default, or `KUBE_NOOB_DATA_DIR`.

| File | Contents | How to remove it |
|---|---|---|
| `progress/<learner>.json` | Lessons read, exercise and quiz results, points. The learner id is a label you choose (default `local`); use a nickname, not an email address | Delete the file |
| `learning.json` | Your profile (platform, versions, team conventions) and fixes you confirmed (symptom, cause, fix). Notes that contain credentials, logs or manifests are rejected. Counters record rule and playbook ids only, never your text | `kube-noob learning forget <id>`, delete the file, or set `learningEnabled: false` |
| `corpus/` | Documents you indexed with `corpus add-docs` (credentials masked), and public corpus data you built or imported | Delete the directory |

Nothing from a request is kept after it is answered. What is listed above stays until you delete it; the maintainers
never receive it.

`kube-noob bundle` writes a redacted evidence pack to the folder you name (default `./kube-noob-bundle`). The MCP
server's log line records each tool name, argument sizes and duration, never argument contents.

## What it sends, and where

By default, nothing. Each destination below is off until you turn it on.

| Destination | Turned on by | What is sent |
|---|---|---|
| Your cluster's API server | `cluster.enabled: true` or `--cluster-enabled` | Read-only get, list and logs requests |
| Allowlisted documentation sites (listed below) | `webEnabled: true`; refused under the offline lock | HTTPS GET of the page address; nothing is downloaded to disk or run |
| The model you configure | Only `kube-noob ask`, `kube-noob train bench` and the eval judge | Your question and the tool results; under the offline lock, local models only |
| Public GitHub repositories and the public Red Hat Jira | Only `kube-noob corpus build`, `jira` and `history` (maintainers and CI); refused under the offline lock | Requests for public data |

The default web allowlist is kubernetes.io, helm.sh, docs.redhat.com, docs.openshift.com, access.redhat.com,
cloud.redhat.com, developers.redhat.com, redhat.atlassian.net, docs.aws.amazon.com, github.com,
raw.githubusercontent.com, stackrox.io, www.stackrox.io, gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io and kind.sigs.k8s.io, with their
subdomains. You can shorten or replace it with `web.allowedDomains`.

`kube-noob doctor` prints what the running process can reach. Administrators can set `offline: true` (or
`KUBE_NOOB_OFFLINE=1`) to block web access and downloads and to allow only local models; nothing later in the
configuration can lift it.

## The Claude plugin

The plugin starts the bundled server on your computer over stdio, with web access, cluster access and model calls
off. Its Python dependencies are installed from PyPI at the versions and hashes in the plugin's `uv.lock`, into the
plugin's data folder. Personal data is never requested. If text you paste contains some, it is processed in memory
and not stored, except words you choose to put in a confirmed note or a learner id.

## Children

kube-noob is not directed at children under 18.
