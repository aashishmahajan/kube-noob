"""Prometheus metrics for the HTTP server: counters and gauges, no customer data.

Why this exists: a platform team will not run a pod it cannot alert on, and until now the server had no `/metrics`,
the chart had no PrometheusRule, and there was no way to be told that the corpus had gone stale or that the tools
had started failing. That is the third of platform requirement R6.5 and roadmap item N11.

Three decisions worth stating, because each one is a defect if taken the other way.

**No new dependency.** The Prometheus text format is four fields per line, so it is rendered here. Adding
`prometheus_client` would mean a new hash-pinned runtime dependency, in a tool whose distribution argument is that
it runs in a disconnected cluster, for a format that fits in this file.

**Bounded label values.** `run_tool` records `outcome=<ExceptionName>` for any `KubeNoobError` or `ValueError`, and
exception types are open-ended: a caller who can provoke a new one would otherwise add a Prometheus label value
every time, which is a cardinality attack on the monitoring system rather than on this process. Every label value
here is mapped into a fixed set first, and `tool` is only accepted when it is a tool this server actually serves.

**Nothing about the caller.** Tool name, surface, outcome and duration. No argument, no resource name, no
namespace, no manifest content, no remote address. A metric is scraped by whoever can reach the port and kept for
months, so it is the last place customer data should appear.

Counters are process-local, and the chart runs one process, so the numbers are that pod's. They are not shared
across replicas and this module does not pretend otherwise.
